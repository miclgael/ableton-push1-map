# Push 1 mappings for MidiPipe

All Push buttons mapped to MidiPipe (WIP) TODO: everything.

From there you can make the AppleScript call whatever other tricks you like.

I used this to turn my push drum pads into an Elgato Streamdeck clone.

You could make the drum pads call APIs, or automate tasks, or whatever you like!

## Requirements

- [SubtleSoft MidiPipe](http://www.subtlesoft.square7.net/MidiPipe.html)
- Set input to Push "User"
- Set output to "AppleScript Trigger"
